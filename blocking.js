// What is crypto ?

// Node.js has a core library known as crypto , which is used for cryptographic operations like generating secure keys, hashing passwords, and more.

//  The crypto module is one of the core modules provided by Node.js, similar to other core modules like https , fs (file system), and zlib (used for compressing files).

// These core modules are built into Node.js, so when you write require('crypto') , you're importing a module that is already present in Node.js.

//  You can also import it using require('node:crypto') to explicitly indicate that it ºs a core module, but this is optional.
